# MGMT
This was a project that i worked on privately. Well things didn't go as planned and you can have a layout of a Storage Management software.
Somewhere around in the code there should be the footprint of the Database I built.
The feature that allows you(the user) to dynamically fill out prompts and resolve them at runtime back through the database, well i call it TITM(Translator in the middle).
There is almost complete functionality for locale translation, although somewhere its written in Bulgarian.
